Please browse the projects below(link here)/my GitHub(link here) to see evidence of this.Alongside these I am also self learning and gaining a foundation in C# and Unity.#### Passion / CuriosityQuitting a career after 10years? Completely retraining in field that you are a hobbyist at best in? If it doesn’t take passion and curiosity to do this then what does? Maybe I waited to long to do this but I’m here now and that’s what matters. Out of anything career related I have done, the 16 week Makers Academy course has been the most rewarding/fulfilling out of the lot and has only reinforced my passion for tech and entrenched in me that this is what I want to do with my life.#### The hunger – a quick and adaptable learnerLearning the above Dev skills in 16 weeks shows I’m a quick learner and adaptable. New languages, frameworks, teams, and challenges? No problem! Just like in the real world, techs change and you need someone who is proven to be able react to this and learn and change along with it. Coming back to Coutts & Co. in May 2015 I picked up the new overhauled system so quickly that by the December I was invited to join QA/Testing Change Management team to ensure that UAT and Regression tests were passing – despite others having 2+ more years experience on the system.#### ExperienceNow I’m no bright-eyed young Doe mesmerized by the bright lights of the city but I’m no over the hill old Stag either…… But I do have a ton of real world life and working experience, maybe not a direct correlation between my old field and the tech world but priceless skills such as how to be a team player, leadership, time management, how to work to deadlines etc….. and importantly communication are all there. I have presented to CEOs, broken bread with Bedouins under the desert sky and made friends on the New York subway. Communication is important anywhere, no less than in the workplace and even more so in areas where teams need to collaborate and flow creatively together.#### Honorable mentions….Cool and calm – I’m from the Southern Hemisphere, just try and get me stressed out… Seriously though, I do have a cool head under pressure and prefer to tackle problems head on and rise to the challenge. I’m not saying I always succeed but I don’t let the situation get the better of me.Attention to detail – Working within QA/test teams and environments you need to have the attention to detail to know when things are going wrong, even if it seems like it’s right. Working in Finance also hones this - miss a digit, a comma, wrong column? All these can have major consequences so attention to detail is paramount.## Projects| Project | Description | Techs | Timeframe || ------- | ----------- | ----- | --------- |## Education#### Makers Academy (September 2016 to December 2016)- Object-oriented design- Agile Methodologies- Test driven development and behaviour driven development- SOLID, MVC- Software Craftsmanship- RESTful APIs- Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Node.js, Angular.js- Rspec, Jasmine, Mocha#### Victoria University (New Zealand) (graduated 2005)- Bachelor of Arts with honours – Double major in Media Studies and Classics#### Any other qualifications- ISTQB-BCS Certified Software Tester Foundation Level (2016)- Certificate in HTML5 & CSS Web Design & Development (Yoobee School of Design, New Zealand, 2014)- Certificate in Web Design and Development (Open Polytechnic, New Zealand, 2013)## Experience**Coutts & Co, London** (May 2015 to September 2016)    *Officer2 / QA/Test role*  **TSB Bank, New Zealand** (June 2014 to September 2014)   *Treasury/Financial Support*  **ANZ Bank, New Zealand** (April 2013 to April 2014)    *Assistant Manager, Business Banking*  **Coutts & Co, London** (Aug 2009 to Nov 2012)    *Senior Lending Officer*  **Coutts & Co, London** (Sept 2008 to Aug 2009)    *Manager, London Booking Centre*  ## Interests## Contact- Github: [crispinandrews](https://github.com/crispinandrews)- LinkedIn: [Crispin Andrews](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/crispin-andrews-9992b388)
